 * It is necessary say which parameters you have changed:
 * 	For example if you want to run the motor for 5 seconds with 50 of speed you have to do:
 * 
 * 		1º Call the function pistorms_motor_run_secs(int connector_id, int time)
 * 		2º Call the function  pistorms_motor_set_speed(int connector_id,int speed)
