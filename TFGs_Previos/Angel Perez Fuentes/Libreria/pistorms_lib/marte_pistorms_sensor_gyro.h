 * @brief Driver for control the Gyro of EV3 Sensor.
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * This is a C library for Raspberry Pi (RPi). It provides control over gyro sensor.
 * This sensor gives us the rotational motion on a single axis and the total rotation angle in degrees.

 * @brief Read data of the Gyro Sensor depends on the mode.
 * @param connector_id Bank and Port to plug the sensor.
 * @param mode it could be "ANGLE" or "RATE".
 * @return  the angle in degrees if ANGLE or the rotational speed in degrees per second if RATE.
 * 
 * Mode Angle:
 * You can use this rotation angle to detect, for example,
 * how far your robot has turned. This feature means you are able to
 * program turns (on the axis the Gyro Sensor is measuring) with an
 * accuracy of +/- 3 degrees for a 90-degree turn.
 * 
 * Mode Rate:
 * If you rotate the Gyro Sensor in the direction
 * of the arrows on the case of the sensor, the sensor can detect
 * the rate of rotation in degrees per second. (The sensor can measure
 * a maximum rate of spin of 440 degrees per second).
