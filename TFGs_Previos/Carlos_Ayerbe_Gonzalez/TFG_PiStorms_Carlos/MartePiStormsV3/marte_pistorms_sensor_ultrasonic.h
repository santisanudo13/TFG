 * @brief Driver for control the Ultrasonic of EV3 Sensor.
 * @version 1.0
 *
 * This is a C library for Raspberry Pi (RPi). It provides control over ultrasonic sensor.
 * This sensor gives us the distance to an object in front of it. It does this by sending out
 * high-frequency sound waves and measuring how long it takes
 * the sound to reflect back to the sensor.(It could be in centimeters or in inches).
 * Also this sensor can detect another Ultrasonic Sensor operating nearby.
 * When listening for presence, the sensor detects sound signals but does not send them.
